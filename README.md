# Factory-Robot-Hazard-Analyzer
# 🤖 Factory Robot Hazard Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
The Factory Robot Hazard Analyzer is a structured system designed to evaluate robot safety risks in an industrial environment.  
It is implemented using a Use Case (UC) based incremental development approach, where each UC adds a new feature to the system.

# 🧩 Use Case Details

---

## 🟢 UC1: System Initialization

### 🎯 Objective
Display a system title when the program starts.

### 💡 Description
This use case ensures the user understands the system they are interacting with.

### 📌 Output Behavior
- Displays a welcome banner
- Indicates system startup

---

## 🟢 UC2: Accept and Display Input

### 🎯 Objective
Collect robot hazard parameters from the user.

### 💡 Description
The system takes the following inputs:
- Arm precision value
- Worker density in factory
- Machine condition (Worn / Faulty / Critical)

### 📌 Output Behavior
- Accepts user inputs
- Displays confirmation after successful input

---

## 🟢 UC3: Refactor Logic into Auditor Module

### 🎯 Objective
Separate hazard calculation logic into a dedicated module.

### 💡 Description
This improves system structure by isolating calculation logic from input handling.

### 📌 Benefits
- Better code organization
- Easier maintenance
- Reusability of logic

---

## 🟢 UC4: Custom Exception Handling

### 🎯 Objective
Introduce a custom exception for invalid hazard inputs.

### 💡 Description
This ensures the system can handle incorrect or unsafe input values gracefully.

### 📌 Benefits
- Strong error handling
- Improved system reliability
- Clear error messages

---

## 🟢 UC5: Input Validation with Exception Handling

### 🎯 Objective
Validate all user inputs before processing.

### 💡 Description
The system checks:
- Arm precision must be within valid range
- Worker density must be within allowed limits
- Machine state must be valid (Worn, Faulty, Critical)

### 📌 Benefits
- Prevents invalid calculations
- Ensures system safety
- Avoids runtime errors

---

## 🟢 UC6: Hazard Risk Calculation Enhancement

### 🎯 Objective
Improve accuracy of hazard risk scoring.

### 💡 Description
Risk is computed using weighted factors based on:
- Robot arm precision
- Worker density
- Machine condition risk level

### 📌 Outcome
- More realistic hazard evaluation
- Better simulation of industrial conditions

---

## 🟢 UC7: User-Friendly Output Integration

### 🎯 Objective
Display a structured hazard report.

### 💡 Description
All inputs and calculated risk values are combined into a readable report format.

### 📌 Output Includes
- Arm precision value
- Worker density
- Machine condition
- Final hazard risk score

---

## 🟢 UC8: Graceful Program Termination

### 🎯 Objective
Ensure proper system shutdown.

### 💡 Description
The system closes resources and terminates safely after execution.

### 📌 Benefits
- Prevents resource leaks
- Provides clean exit experience
- Professional system behavior
